    <h1>My Self</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Suraj Gupta, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA).

I am deeply engaged in learning and honing my skills in full-stack web development, a fascinating and dynamic area of study that merges both the front-end and back-end aspects of creating robust and engaging websites and applications.</p>
