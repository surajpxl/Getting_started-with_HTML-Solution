    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>HTML comments are used to add explanatory or descriptive text within the HTML code that won't be displayed in the web browser. This helps developers annotate their code for better understanding or to temporarily disable certain sections. To create a comment in HTML, you enclose the text within <!-- and -->. </p>
